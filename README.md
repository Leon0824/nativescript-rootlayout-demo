```bash
git clone https://github.com/williamjuan027/nativescript-rootlayout-demo.git

cd nativescript-rootlayout-demo/ng-demo
```

Install the project's dependencies

```bash

```

You can then run the app on iOS and Android using the following commands:

npm run start.android
```

> This app uses the new RootLayout component from Nativescript 8 which is still curently in alpha, make sure that the latest Nativescript alpha is installed prior to running the app

```
